## Description
[Repo](https://github.com/escowin/readme-generator) 

This application captures user input through the terminal, and generates a data-rich `README.md` in Markdown format. Template literal functions were improved & consolidated through Test-Driven Development principles. Furthermore, the incorporation of \n was crucial in removing any instances of undesirable whitespace from the generated output codebase.
